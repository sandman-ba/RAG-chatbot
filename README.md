If you want to use your GPU for `torch`, you must download the appropriate version for your GPU model. See the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ 'PyTorch website') to find the url. Then add it to your `Pipfile` as described in the [Pipenv documentation](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/indexes.html 'Pipenv Documentation').
